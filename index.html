                  Hi! I'm Alex, and I've built this business from my strong passion for cars. 
                  I'm currently enrolled as a full time college student, reached the highest rank of Eagle in Boy Scouts, and I work another job. 
                  I've always had this urge to make it big starting my own business and eventually create a YouTube channel all about it! 
                  I cannot wait to see where the future takes me and I cant thank anyone enough for supporting me in my dreams.
        <br> <br> If you have any inquiries or suggestions that you would like to see added in the future, you may do so by tagging  our Facebook or using our email. 
                  Your feedback is greatly appreciated and I hope you spread the word about my business!

               <!-- <h2>Thank you for taking the time to read the policy page! 
                    I know you are eager to schedule your appointment but theres information you need to know.
                     For clarification, I am still learning and devoting a lot of my time as a small business. 
                     When you schedule a time slot, you will hold your time slot until your scheduled detail time. 
                     You can cancel or reschedule your detail for any open slot BEFORE 48 hours of your previously scheduled time without any penalty. 
                     Anything AFTER are subject to a $20 fee. NO SHOWS are subject to a $30 fee. 
                     The reason for this is due to repurposing the time from one job to another to grow as a business.
                     The payment method will be the same as regular payments via Cash App, Venmo, or Cash in-hand.
                     I truly appreciate your understanding for this and if any issues arise, please contact via email, facebook, or both for best response time. 
                     Thank you again for reading! </h2>-->

                    I know you are eager to schedule your appointment, but there's some important information you need to know.
                     When you schedule a time slot, a non-refundable deposit of $20 must be paid 48 hours prior to your scheduled time slot or else your appointment will be cancelled.
                     This deposit must be paid through Cashapp or Venmo with the description: "For <i>appointment date</i>". <br><br> For days when the forcast shows rain, exterior details will have to be rescheduled and interior details can only be done if a garage space is available. Your phone number is required while scheduling and it is likely we will contact you about further details.  </h2></li>
